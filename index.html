            <h3>Panels and Workspaces</h3>
            <p>The After Effects interface includes panels like the Project panel, Composition panel, Timeline, and Effects panel, each designed to streamline workflow. Adobe After Effects features a customizable workspace with essential panels like the Project, Timeline, Composition, and Effects panels. Each panel serves a specific function, allowing users to import media, apply effects, organize assets, and manage layers, all within an adaptable layout that enhances the editing workflow.</p>

            <h3>Timeline and Composition</h3>
            <p>The Timeline panel allows control over the timing of layers and effects, while the Composition panel displays the visual output of your animations. The Timeline and Composition panels are where users structure and control their animations. The Timeline panel manages layer order, keyframes, and timing, while the Composition panel provides a live preview of the animation. Together, they form the core workspace for organizing and refining visual elements.</p>
